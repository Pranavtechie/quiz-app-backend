It consists of a stack and a task queue. The stack contains the synchronous tasks that are being executed, and the task queue contains the asynchronous tasks waiting to be executed.\\n\\nIn this code snippet, setTimeout is an asynchronous task that schedules the function to be executed after a certain delay. However, the delay specified is 0, which means the function is scheduled to be executed as soon as possible, but still asynchronously. Promise.resolve().then is another asynchronous task that is scheduled to be executed after the current synchronous code block has finished executing.\\n\\nTherefore, the order of execution is as follows:\\n\\n1. The synchronous code console.log('C') is executed first, printing 'C' to the console.\\n2. The asynchronous task scheduled by setTimeout is executed next, printing 'A' to the console.\\n3. The asynchronous task scheduled by Promise.resolve().then is executed last, printing 'B' to the console.\\n\\nHence, the output of the code is 'A B C'.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"What does the following code snippet demonstrate?\",\n    \"questionDescription\": \"```javascript\\nconst button = document.querySelector('button');\\nconst handler = () => {\\n  alert('Button clicked!');\\n};\\n\\nbutton.addEventListener('click', handler);\\nbutton.removeEventListener('click', handler);\\n```\",\n    \"options\": [\"A: Adding an event listener and removing it immediately\", \"B: Adding an event listener to a button\", \"C: Removing an event listener from a button\", \"D: Toggling an event listener on a button\"],\n    \"answer\": 0,\n    \"explanation\": \"The code snippet demonstrates adding an event listener to a button using the addEventListener method and subsequently removing it using the removeEventListener method.\\n\\nIn this code snippet, the button variable is assigned with the reference to a button element, which is obtained using the document.querySelector method. The handler variable is defined as an arrow function that displays an alert when executed.\\n\\nThen, the addEventListener method is called on the button element, passing 'click' as the event type and the handler function as the event listener. This attaches the event listener to the button, so that when the button is clicked, the handler function is executed.\\n\\nFinally, the removeEventListener method is called on the button element, again passing 'click' as the event type and the handler function as the event listener. This removes the event listener from the button.\\n\\nHence, the code snippet demonstrates adding an event listener to a button and then immediately removing it.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"What is the purpose of the following code?\",\n    \"questionDescription\": \"```javascript\\nconst fetchData = async () => {\\n  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\\n  const data = await response.json();\\n  return data;\\n};\\n```\",\n    \"options\": [\"A: Fetch data from an API and return it\", \"B: Send a request to an API and receive a response\", \"C: Convert a response object to JSON format\", \"D: Display a response received from an API\"],\n    \"answer\": 0,\n    \"explanation\": \"The purpose of the code is to fetch data from an API and return it. This is achieved using the fetch function and the async/await syntax in JavaScript.\\n\\nIn this code snippet, the fetchData function is defined as an async function. The function uses the await keyword to pause the execution until the promise returned by the fetch function resolves. The fetch function is used to send a request to the specified URL ('https://api.example.com/data') and returns a promise that resolves to a Response object.\\n\\nOnce the response is received, the await keyword is used again to pause the execution until the promise returned by the json method of the Response object resolves. This method reads and parses the response body as JSON.\\n\\nFinally, the data variable is assigned with the parsed JSON data, and the data is returned from the function.\\n\\nTherefore, the purpose of the code is to fetch data from an API and return it for further processing.\"\n  }\n]"
